<H1> Crossword Designer </H1>
<P>
Crossword Designer is a program to construct crosswords. It is available for Microsoft Windows.
It is suitable for designing crosswords for educational use, or a for a church or club 
magazine. It is free and open source. It's not intended to be a competitor to commercial
crossword design packages, but to cater to the occasional user.
</P>
<P>
To get Crossword Designer simply download the executable from 
<A href="https://github.com/MalcolmMcLean/CrosswordDesigner/releases/latest/download/CrosswordDesigner.exe">
CrosswordDesigner.exe</A>. It is a Windows executable with no dependencies. If you are a developer and
want to contribute to program or wish to submit a bug report or suggestion, the project is hosted 
on GitHub

<H3> Basic use </H3>
<P>
Crossword Designer is very simple to use. Use the arrow keys or the mouse to move the green
square cursor over the crossword, then press a letter key to generate a letter, the space key
to generate a space, or the delete/backspace key to generate a black square. Numbering and
clue numbering is done automatically. When you are happy with the grid, fill in the clues.
To create crosswords with a theme, for example on the reading of the day for a church
magazine, the hand-generated method is probably the best way.
</P>
<H3> Auto fill </H3>
<P>
Crossword construction software wouldn't be crossword construction software without an
auto-fill method. Crosword Designer lets you choose the word difficulty level. It then
auto-fill any empty spaces on the grid, when you select &quot;Fill grid&quot; from the edit menu.
English-style crosswords usually auto-fill almost instantaneously. American-style
grids with densely-interlocking words are much more challenging. Try to choose a grid
which has separate regions with only one or two connections between them, and not too
many long words. Or try filling in some of the longer words, which you have to do for 
&quot;theme&quot; entries anyway. Also, set the word difficulty to &quot;very rare&quot;. 
This will generate a crossword with some very obscure words, which is a feature of
American-style crosswords which is difficult to avoid. American-style grids can take 
many hours to auto-fill, and might never fill at all.

</TABLE>
<P>
Whilst using the auto-fill to generate a complete crossword from a random starter grid is
fun, to create a high-quality crossword it is necessary to have some human input. The
word matcher dialog will suggest words from the dictionary. There is also an anagram 
finder to help with the construction of clues. If designing a crossword on a theme,
it is a lot easier to abandon the convention that the grid must be symmetrical.

<H3> Data import and export </H3>
<P>
By default, Crossword Designer saves files in the .xpf format. However this format has
never really caught on in the community. The most common format is the .puz. Puz files
are proprietary and it is necessary to rely on unofficial documentation. Crossword Designer
doesn't currently handle scrambled .puz files (these are designed for end-users, so 
that the solution can't be revealed by casually examining the binary), and it cannot
handle .puz files with features that Crossword Designer doesn't support, like non-
Latin characters. Ipuz is an open source alternative to .puz. Crossword Designer has
very basic support for .ipuz files. To submit crosswords created with Crossword Designer to
third parties, you will probably want to save to .puz format.
</P>
<P>
If you are publishing your own magazine, you will also want to export crosswords from
Crossword Designer into a format readable by your desktop publishing software. 
Crossword Designer provides a way of copying the puzzle grid to the clipboard,
the solution grid to the clipboard, the solution grid as text (you will want to
format it in your own software), and the clues as text. Paste into the desktop
publishing software and format for your specific needs.
</P>
<P>
If you are publishing the crosswords on the web, Crossword Designer offers two export
options, static HTML and interactive HTML. Static HTML allows the end user to print 
off the crossword to complete with pencil and paper. Interactive HTML creates a
page with Javascript in which he can enter the solution. An example can be found
<A href="AmericanGrid1.html"> here </A>. You can just out up these pages and link to
them from your own website, or edit them simply to match your house style.
